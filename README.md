# Backend API with TypeScript and PostgreSQL

## Description

This project is a backend API developed with **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**. The application includes database seeding, environment-specific configurations, and robust testing with **Jest**. It demonstrates best practices in backend development, type safety, and database management.

> **Note:** Due to NDA restrictions, the `.env` files, test data, and seed generation files have been excluded from the repository and cannot be shared.

## Features

- **Database Integration**: Built with PostgreSQL, ensuring efficient and secure data handling.
- **TypeScript Migration**: Transitioned the project from JavaScript to TypeScript for enhanced type safety and maintainability.
- **Seeding and Automation**: Includes a streamlined database seeding process using `pg-format` and automated workflows with `psql`.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive tests written in **Jest**, ensuring functionality and reliability.
- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Utilizes `dotenv` for secure and adaptable environment setups.
- **Error Handling**: Detailed and robust error handling for better debugging and production stability.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- PostgreSQL (v13 or later)
- npm or yarn
- TypeScript (globally installed, optional)

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/munaciella/data-analytics-api
   cd data-analytics-api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create environment files**:  
   Create `.env.development`, `.env.test`, and `.env.production` files in the project root, based on your environments. The `.env` files are not included in the repository.

4. **Database Setup**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
   - Create a new database:
     ```bash
     createdb ultimate_hero
     ```
   - Update the `.env` file with your database credentials.

5. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   psql -d ultimate_hero -f ./migrations/<migration_file.sql>
   ```

6. **Seed the database**:
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```
